Chest Commands
===================

Bukkit Page: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/chest-commands

This is an updated version of ChestCommands which makes it compatible with 1.12 for 
replacement while I fix HubBasics.

NO new features were added, it's just a compatibility fix.

To compile, use `mvn -U clean package`. (Also check the releases page if you need)

The source code is 100% original, with just some minor changes for compatibility, I noticed it's extremely
"bad-written" (static abuse breaks the "abuse" barrier) but it worked in the past, so it's ok.
